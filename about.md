## What is CS 196: The Foundry? [ROUGH DRAFT]

CS 196 is where miracles happen. CS 196 is where dreams become reality. CS 196 is greater than combined forces of love and life. We are a class from the fine institution of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and we make sure that the world knows of our greatness.
