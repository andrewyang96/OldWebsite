Reporting from the first CS 196 hackathon, this is Andrew Yang. Everyone is busy working on their projects and building great things.

Selected quotes:

## What makes CS 196 exciting?

> I'm looking forward to taking this course because I want to immerse myself in various aspects of computer programming. On another perspective, I also want to know if doing this kind of thing for the next four years is my passion, and by taking CS 196 this semester, I'll definitely find out. — I.L.

> I am excited to be taking a class that provides real life experiences. It is really cool that both non-coders and people who know five different languages can take the same class. — S.B.

> Cooperation and innovation. — S.C.

> I'm excited to be doing something I've never done before. I have never coded Java before, so coming into CS 125 is fairly intimidating for me. That being said, the creative possibilities that exist in the computer science world have been the reason I decided to pursue the field. So now, I feel like I'm jumping into it from the start--seeing the end result instead of only the busywork in between. I'm also very interested in the liberal arts, which is why I'm pursuing a Computer Science+Anthro degree. This class is perfect for combining the liberal arts with computer science, because I could use my knowledge of culture and civilizations to understand better the project I'll be pursuing. — S.R.

> Personally speaking, the most exciting part of this course is that we are going to make a real project which can actually makes some impact to the world […] The hands-on opportunity really makes me thrill [sic]. What is more, the fact that we are going to learn knowledge that is not taught in the classroom also amazed [sic] me. — Y.Z.

> I can apply the stuff I learn in class to real-world stuff such as apps and websites. This is especially valuable freshman year, and I think this is what differentiates UIUC from other universities. — A.Y.

> The most awesome thing about this course is that we, the students, are able to anything we want. Instead of following a syllabus set by a professor, we are able to figure out what to do as we move along the course. In addition, if the project does take off, we can turn the project into a product, and I believe doing so will be extremely beneficial to my future career. — H.H.J.

> The experience of creating an idea, tweaking it based on the suggestions of peers, then implementing and building off of that idea is a string of events that will be very common after graduation in the workplace. Being able to experience that now will certainly be helpful in the future. — A.G.

> CS is all about being wizards in the sense that you're able to magically create programs out of some simple instructions. I love that this course allows us to jump right into creating projects. — A.S.

> With the wonderful community at UIUC and CS196, I hope that I'll be able to create something out of virtually nothing that can do some kind of good. — V.L.

> I am excited to have a fully functional and potentially marketable product at the end of the semester. Game development in particular has always been a goal of mine; to see my name scroll on a list of credits for a big game and know I was a big part of making it would be awesome. This project will give me tons of hands on experience coding and a good insight on the process of working in teams to develop software that I couldn't easily get anywhere else. — W.D.

> I signed up for CS 196 because I see programming and coding as a form of expression. I managed to get really pumped for this course because I was interested in owning my education and meeting other people who were equally excited about Computer Science. My TA, Thomas makes it really easy to see complex projects come to life. After I joined, I realized that a good handful of people in cs196 lived in my residence hall, and three of them were on my floor. The rigorous coursework and help form peers is what makes this class so great. — D.M.

> It's about working to create something, not just learn. When I exit the class, I will have created something usable, and maybe even useful. That's what makes 196 exciting. — A.K.

> What really makes this course exciting is the potential knowledge we may be able to gain out of it. I've never seen a staff of teachers this excited about a course, and it really makes me want to put in the effort. Because of how excited the staff is, it's made me want to focus and give my all on this project because it seems like it could be life changing, and I've never been able to say that about a course before.

> I feel this class is unique in that very early on in their time in college, students are given the space and resources to try and create things that they think are worth while. It is a course that is student driven and gives like minded people an introduction to each other. It also gives an introduction to software engineering, giving students the ability to work of APIs and SDKs a skill that may be daunting at the beginning but is required for any sort of software development. — N.D.

> The most exciting aspect of the course is its open ended nature, and the fact that it is more about applying our skills than simply learning from a professor. I feel like this course will give us the chance to test our limits, and see the true magnitude of what we can create. — A.S.
